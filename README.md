# TTK4900---NCL

This repo contains the code using in my master thesis regarding diversity in homogenous ensembles

The code was orginially designed for use in a juyputer notebook. 

div_vs_loss.py contains code for making plots and comparing diversity vs loss. It also contains the GradCAM implementation, and functions made to produce the activation histograms. 

NCL.py contains the implementation of negative correlation learning.
